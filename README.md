## About Portal MCB

This project aims to provide a web-based App for managing clients, stakeholders, work orders and finances in a customized way for a company that acts as an intermediary in the provision of services for Brazilians who live abroad and have legal demands in Brazil.

- Quick view of potential customers who have contacted but have not yet ordered the service,
- Fast and easy view of work orders in progress,
- Dashboard with financial and management information for customers and suppliers,
- Registration of customer and stakeholder information.

Portal MCB will be acessible by a temporary login that will be avaiable as soon as the project is concluded.
